mov eax, [ebx+esi*4+0x10]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at the address calculated by `ebx + esi * 4 + 0x10`.  The problem is that it doesn't check if the resulting address is valid before dereferencing it. If `ebx` and `esi` have values that cause the calculated address to fall outside the allocated memory region, the program will crash with a segmentation fault or access violation.
